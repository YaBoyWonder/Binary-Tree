<strong>What is a binary tree?</strong>

The binary tree is a fundamental data structure used in computer science. The binary tree is 
a useful data structure for rapidly storing sorted data and rapidly retrieving stored data. 
It is composed of parent nodes, or leaves, each of which stores data and also links to up to two 
other child nodes (leaves) which can be visualized spatially as below the first node with one placed to 
the left and with one placed to the right.
